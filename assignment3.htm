   My name is <em><strong>Babajide Eniola</strong></em>.My friends call me enny.I live in Ogun State which is a state in the western part of Nigeria.
I'm the only female child in my family-I have three elder brothers, so my mum calls me Morenikeji.My parents are both civil servants although my dad is retired.

When I was a child, my dream was to be a doctor or a nurse, helping to save lives in the heat of moments, but as I grew older I realized that it takes more than wanting to be able to acheive something; you have to be capable or train to be capable. Soon enough, I realized that I just couldn't stand the sight of blood and a "tear up" at any sight of suffering. From all indications, taking care of sick people wasn't for me.By then the interest was gone.Now, I had to do something about making a career choice. After some deep soul searching and research i decided to study computer science. Now, I am a student of Kwara State University in the department of <i>Computer Science</i>.
